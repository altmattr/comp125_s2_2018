# Motivation for searching algorithms

Searching for *something* is one of the most fundamental operations on
which more complex algorithms are based. Consider some of the following
real-life scenarios,

-   Check if a particular student is enrolled in a unit.

-   Check if there are any items between a certain price range in the
    bill.

-   Compute the number of debit transactions over a certain amount in
    your monthly credit card statement.

-   Determine a mutually suitable time for a meeting between 2 people
    (and more broadly $n$ people) based on their calendars.

-   Determine the number of public holidays on a Friday/Monday (Yes!)

-   Find the number of rows in a spreadsheet that have a keyword in it.

-   Find the number of rows in a spreadsheet that have any one of $n$
    keywords in it.

-   Find the number of rows in a spreadsheet that have every one of $n$
    keywords in it.

All these problems rely on searching through some data set.

So, itâ€™s really very simple! You need searching to become good at
algorithms that build on top of it.

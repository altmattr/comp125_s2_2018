# Software to install and first program

Install the following software **in the order below**. You will be asked to choose your operating system for each software, and whether it's 32-bits or 64-bits. If not sure, use this [link](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001121.htm) to determine the same.

1. [**Java Standard Edition (Java SE)**](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), previously known as Java Standard Development Kit (Java SDK). Current version (on the date of writing this document): `10.0.2`. You'll be fine as long as you have version 8 or above.

2. [**Eclipse IDE for Java developers**](https://eclipse.org/downloads/). Current version (on the date of writing this document): `Photon`. Previous versions `Oxygen` and `Neon` should also be ok.

**NOTE:** You are free to use any other IDE besides Eclipse (such as NetBeans or IntelliJ) if you want. However, we shall be doing all screencasts and video tutorials using Eclipse.

## First java program

Once you have installed Java SE, you are ready to write and run Java programs. First we'll learn how to write and run a java program from command prompt.

Open notepad and type the following code in it.

```java
public class MyFirstProgram {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello world!");
	}
}
```

Save the file as `MyFirstProgram.java` \(case sensitive\).

Open command prompt \(or terminal on Mac\), go to the folder in which `MyFirstProgram.java` exists, and type the following:

~~~
javac MyFirstProgram.java
~~~
{: .bash}

> This is the *compilation* step.

If everything went ok, it would execute this command and generate a new file named `MyFirstProgram.class` in the same directory as`MyFirstProgram.java`. This is the *classfile* or *bytecode*. It's this file that actually executes. Once it's generated, you can even delete the source file \(`MyFirstProgram.java`\) provided you don't need to make any further changes\).

You run the classfile using the `java` command.

~~~
java MyFirstProgram
~~~
{: .bash}

> This is the *execution* step.

If there are no run-time errors, you will get the following output on the console.

~~~
Hello world!
~~~
{: .output}

## First java program in Eclipse

## Adding more functions to a java program

You will notice that the `main` function is labelled `static` by Java. Your program will not run if you remove this keyword. A function being `static` means that the only data it operates on (if any) are the parameters passed.

Equivalent versions of the same function in `Processing` and `Java` are provided below -

| Processing                                                                                      | Java |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|

The `public` keyword is for consistency and will be used for all functions unless explicitly specified to be `private` \(again, more about this in week 2 and 3\).
